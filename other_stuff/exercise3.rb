# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?
#
# Exception handling allows you to "rescue" your code by adding code to be executed
# in case of an error. This saves your program from halting if it encounters an error,
# by allowing the program to execute the rescue code and then moving on to the next
# piece of code.
